### Hi there ðŸ‘‹  Welcome to my GitHub! 

### My name is Mira and I'm a full-stack software developer pursuing inclusion, accessibility, equity and soulfulness in the digital world.

### My tech stack focuses on React, Vanilla JS, HTML, CSS, and Express PostgreSQL.
#### I love creating and learning new things - my personal projects employ a calm, user-friendly interface, and my aesthetics are influenced by my Japanese-Korean roots.
