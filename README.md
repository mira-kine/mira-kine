## Hi,

Hi, I'm glad you're here.

## About Me:

 ðŸŒ¸  I focus on React, Vanilla JS, HTML, CSS, and Express PostgreSQL.

 ðŸŒ¸  My tech stack also includes:
  - Languages: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
  - Libraries + Frameworks: React, Redux, Node.js, Tailwind CSS, jQuery, Express
  - Testing: TDD, Jest, QUnit, Snapshot, Supertest
  - Databases: PostgreSQL
  - Tools: GitHub, VSCode, Heroku, Netlify, Postman, Miro, Photoshop, Procreate, Canva, Beekeeper
  - In Progress: Typescript, Storybook

 ðŸŒ¸  I love creating and learning new things - my personal projects employ a calm, user-friendly interface, and my aesthetics are influenced by my Japanese-Korean roots.
 
 ðŸŒ¸  I am especially passionate about the intersectionality of tech and mental health to continue globalizing and equalizing access to mental health care  ðŸŒ±
 
 ðŸŒ¸  I express myself through poetry and illustrations and I'm always on the look out for random deep sea facts ðŸŒŠ 

 
Hope you enjoy!
