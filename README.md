## Hi,

Hi, I'm glad you're here. I'm a full-stack software developer pursuing inclusion, accessibility, equity and soulfulness in the digital world.

 ðŸŒ¸ My tech stack also includes:
    - Languages: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
    - Libraries + Frameworks: React, Redux, Node.js, Tailwind CSS, jQuery, Express
    - Testing: TDD, Jest, QUnit, Snapshot, Supertest

 ðŸŒ¸ I love creating and learning new things - my personal projects employ a calm, user-friendly interface, and my aesthetics are influenced by my Japanese-Korean roots. 
 
Hope you enjoy!
